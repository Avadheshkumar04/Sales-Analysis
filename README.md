In this project :-  Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. 
The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

First, we purge our data. This section's tasks include:

Take NaN values out of the DataFrame
deleting rows in response to a condition
Modify the column types (astype, to_numeric, and to_datetime).
We relocate the data exploration part after we have somewhat cleaned up our data. We examine five important business questions pertaining to our data in this section:

Which month saw the highest sales? What was the monthly income?
What city made the largest sales of goods?
When should advertisements be displayed to increase the chance that customers will purchase a product?
Which goods are most frequently offered in tandem?
Which product saw the greatest sales? Why do you think the most of it was sold?
We go over a variety of pandas and matplotlib techniques in order to respond to these queries. 

we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
Adding columns
Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
Using the .apply() method
Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
Labeling our graphs
